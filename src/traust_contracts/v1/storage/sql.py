#: before `report_current` but selects from it, and PostgreSQL resolves a
#: view's references at CREATE time, so the glob order alone fails there
#: while silently succeeding on SQLite.
#: THE SCHEMA IS THE REFERENCE FOR WHAT A VIEW MUST CARRY. A view is not
#: correct because its numbers match another projection -- two projections
#: dropping the same fields agree perfectly and are both wrong. Check it
#: against the artifact's JSON Schema, and let
#: tests/test_view_contract_coverage.py fail you if a declared field never
#: reaches SQL. See storage/v1/README.md, "The schema is the reference".
