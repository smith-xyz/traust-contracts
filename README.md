# Traust Contracts

Source of truth for JSON schemas and enums shared across the Traust ecosystem,
plus generated Python bindings, **the configuration contract** (the one place
that knows what config exists and how it loads), and **storage/v1** (the SQL-first
relational contract and reference write protocol).

## Configuration contract

Contracts owns the configuration *mechanism* for the whole stack — mechanism
only, never estate data:

- **MANIFEST** — the authoritative list of config files (name, required/optional,
  schema, typed model). The single source of truth for “what config exists.”
- **Schemas** — `config/v1/*.schema.json`, applied at load time (versioned
  separately from the `schemas/v1` data schemas).
- **Typed sections + `HarnessContext`** — each file parses into a typed model;
  `HarnessContext` is the frozen bundle of them all.
- **The loader** — `load_context()` (resolve the whole context at an entry point)
  and `load_section()` (one file, for narrow feature-gated readers). Resolution is
  `$TRAUST_CONFIG_HOME`, else the documented default `~/.traust/config` — no env
  overrides, no cwd scanning, no second root.

Consumers declare the subset they need and receive an injected `HarnessContext`
(`traust_engine` never loads config itself); the app (`traust`) is the config
*source* (templates + `install_traust`) and resolves the context once per entry
point. One loader → no two callers disagree about “what the config is.”
Optional `storage.yaml` (e.g. `dsn: postgresql://localhost/traust`) loads as
`context.storage`; `load_section("storage")` provides narrow access. Callers open
connections; `Store` receives them and never resolves configuration.
End-to-end architecture: `traust/docs/architecture.md` → *Configuration & context*.

## Install

```bash
uv add "traust-contracts @ git+https://github.com/traust-security/traust-contracts.git"
```

Go SDK: see [traust-sdk](https://github.com/traust-security/traust-sdk).

## Versioning

Two independent axes:

- **Data-contract version** (`v1`, `v2`, ...) — the shape of schemas/enums
  and everything generated from them. Lives as a real directory; `v2` sits
  beside `v1` once it exists.
- **Package release version** (`VERSION`) — normal semver for this repo.

`traust_contracts.models` / `.enums` / `.paths` alias the current major
(`v1` today). Pin to `traust_contracts.v1.*` directly if the shape must
never move under you.

## Storage contract

`storage/v1` ships readable, authored SQLite/PostgreSQL SQL and a reference
Store that records artifact evidence metadata and caller-owned workflow bindings.
Artifact bytes live in the caller's object store; storage retains the
content-addressed digest and byte size. Every artifact contract has a durable
SQL projection, and scoped views can compose
bindings with those projections. See the [model and write
semantics](storage/v1/README.md). SQL is grouped by database, entity and operation;
there is no ORM or shipped test corpus.

```python
import sqlite3
from pathlib import Path

from traust_contracts.v1.storage import Binding, Store

conn = sqlite3.connect("traust.db")
try:
    store = Store(conn)
    store.init()
    payload = Path("my-vuln-findings.json").read_bytes()
    result = store.ingest(
        "vuln-findings",
        payload,
        Binding(
            subject_id="sci:inventory-item:42",
            run_id="sci:scan-result:7",
        ),
    )
    print(result.digest, result.binding_id, result.already_bound)
finally:
    conn.close()
```

The caller owns an idle connection and supplies opaque context required by the
artifact's hand-authored storage profile. `scope_id` defaults to `local`.
Ingest validates bytes, computes the digest, stores the evidence record, binding,
and any approved projection in one transaction. Raw payload is not retained in
the database. Identical-binding retries are a no-op.
On `IngestError`, the host MUST surface/preserve `error.payload` (the input file
already on disk suffices). The library never chooses a reject path.

SQLite is complete with stdlib; the caller-selected database file is its
physical namespace. PostgreSQL >=14 uses the optional `postgres` extra
(`psycopg>=3`, requiring libpq or separately installed `psycopg[binary]`). Its
relations live in the fixed `traust_storage` schema, created by `init()` when
absent or provisioned beforehand by restricted deployments. Qualified canonical
SQL prevents application relations and `search_path` from redirecting storage.
The scoped views are live; no refresh worker is needed. PostgreSQL filters by
transaction-local `traust.scope_ids`; callers provision tenant permissions.
Storage-internal foreign keys protect binding/evidence/projection integrity;
cross-artifact domain references remain soft.

Storage compatibility metadata is independent of package semver. `init()` rejects
metadata mismatches and does not migrate existing databases. Edit SQL directly and
review compatibility; SQL is not byte-pinned.
Tests use focused synthetic inputs and test fixtures, not a packaged
conformance bundle.

## Ledger relational contract

`ledger/v1` is the SQL-first Ledger database contract, separate from baseline
`storage/v1`. Contracts owns authored PostgreSQL and SQLite DDL — tables,
constraints, indexes, and **append-only enforcement triggers** — plus
deterministic per-file bootstrap order. No ORM binding is shipped.

Bootstrapping from the contracts SQL alone installs the full append-only
contract: events reject UPDATE, DELETE, truncation, and out-of-order sequence
inserts; layers reject deletion. Ledger runtimes pin a Contracts release and
load SQL for fresh databases, keeping migrations, SQLAlchemy bindings, grants,
and persistence behavior local. `IF NOT EXISTS` / `DROP + CREATE` makes the
ledger's separate guard installation idempotent.

`CONTRACT_VERSION = "v1"`, `REVISION = 1`. The singleton `schema_revision` row
(`id = 1`) records version and `applied_at`; mismatches fail explicitly.
`schemas/v1/layer.schema.json` is the portable complete-layer document contract
across file, SQLite, and PostgreSQL backends.

## Validate an artifact

```bash
python validate.py --schema report myreport.json
python validate.py --list
```

## Test

```bash
make setup    # uv sync + enable .githooks
make test     # SQLite + schema tests; PG tests included when db-up
```

PostgreSQL e2e:

```bash
make db-up    # start local Postgres container
make test     # includes PG storage + ledger schema tests
make db-down
```

`tests/test_compat.py` gates breaking JSON Schema changes against the previous tag.
PostgreSQL tests run automatically when `psycopg` and the database are available;
otherwise they skip.
