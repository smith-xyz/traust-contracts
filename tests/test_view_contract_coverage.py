"""A view must expose what its contract declares, or say why not.

The failure this catches is silent and was made three times in one
sitting: a view is authored from the fields someone happened to need,
the numbers agree with whatever else projects the same artifact, and
nobody notices that two thirds of the contract never reached SQL.

Agreement between two projections proves nothing when both drop the
same fields. `advisory_exposure` matched the legacy SQLite projection
exactly on every classification bucket while both were dropping 26 of
the 40 fields `impact-analysis.schema.json` declares -- including every
piece of evidence explaining HOW a classification was reached, which is
the entire point of an impact analysis.

So the reference is the SCHEMA. For every fan-out view, the fields the
contract declares on the item being fanned out must appear in the view,
or be listed in EXEMPT with a reason a reviewer can disagree with.
