-- Threat exposure: every modelled threat classified once, aggregated.
--
-- The census equivalent for the threat lens. `status` is carried through
-- UNCOLLAPSED -- partially_mitigated is the largest bucket in practice
-- (the largest bucket by far), so folding it into mitigated is the single
-- biggest way to overstate threat coverage.
--
-- `evidenced` separates a threat backed by a finding or validation from one
-- that is only modelled. "Unmitigated" and "unevidenced" are different
-- claims and a rollup that blends them cannot be acted on.
