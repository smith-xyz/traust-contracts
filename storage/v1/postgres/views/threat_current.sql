-- Current threats, with the owner of the subject they were modelled against.
--
-- One threat model per subject, and a re-modelled subject must not count
-- twice. Same rule report_current applies to restated reports: most
-- recently bound wins, binding_id breaking ties.
--
-- Resolved per SUBJECT, not per scope. An earlier cut of this view read a
-- fleet-wide register and resolved one current document for the whole
-- scope -- wrong grain, and fed from the dashboard's own output. The
-- estate has one model per subject; that is what this counts.
--
-- Ownership is LEFT JOINed: a threat model can exist for a subject the
-- corpus registry does not declare, and such a model is still real. It
-- simply has no denominator.
