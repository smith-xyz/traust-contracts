-- Per-event projection of a ledger layer: the TIME DIMENSION.
--
-- layer.events is an append-only, chronologically ordered disposition
-- stream -- every validity and resolution change a finding ever went
-- through, each one dated. It was ingested and then discarded:
-- layer_metadata kept only repo, created_at and the merkle root, so
-- storage/v1 could answer "what is open now" and nothing at all about
-- "what was open in July", "how long did this take to fix", or "how long
-- was that regression live".
--
-- Same relationship report_finding has to report.findings: the layer blob
-- stays authoritative and this is a queryable index over it. Measured on
-- the live corpus: tens of events for every layer, across every layer.
--
-- This is why trending needs no scheduled snapshot. An append-only log of
-- dated transitions IS a time series; a snapshot is that log folded at one
-- moment. Keep the log and any past date stays reconstructable; keep only
-- snapshots and everything before the first run is gone forever, from a
-- second source of truth that can drift from the events.
