-- Per-threat projection of the threat register.
--
-- Threat MODELS are prose Markdown and cannot be projected; the register is
-- their structured restatement, and this is one row per threat in it. The
-- register blob stays authoritative -- this is an index over it, the same
-- relationship report_finding has to report.findings.
--
-- `threat_key` is the identity, not `threat_id`: every model numbers its
-- threats from T1, so threat_id alone collides across every model.
