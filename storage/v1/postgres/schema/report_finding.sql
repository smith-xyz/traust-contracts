-- Per-finding projection of a cumulative report.
--
-- report.findings is an opaque JSON column: the disposition every dashboard
-- filters on (validity, resolution) and the identity every distinct-exposure
-- count needs (fingerprint) were present in the contract but unqueryable.
-- This makes them columns without changing what the schema models.
--
-- One row per finding per report binding. Disposition is optional on the
-- artifact -- it appears only on cumulative reports -- so a finding without
-- one still projects, carrying its identity with NULL disposition.
